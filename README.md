## Description:

# I was tasked to create a professional portfolio for future employers.

Step 1: I made a header with appropriate links for each section of my portfolio.

Step 2: When you click each link, the ui guides you to the appropriate section of webpage

Step 3: I added my name underneath the nav bar and displayed a photo of myself.

Step 4: The position of my about me section is underneath the bottom border of my picture.

Step 5: Below that is the project section, two projects are displayed with images and links within the images to lead users to my application.

Step 6: In the footer section there is my contact section, it includes my email address, phone number and a link to my GitHub account.
